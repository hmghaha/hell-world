# HTML and CSS
## Introduction to HTML
### 1. HTML and CSS
- Always put &lt;!DOCTYPE html> on the first line. This tells the browser what language it's reading (in this case, HTML).
- b. Always put &lt;html&gt; on the next line. This starts the HTML document.
- c. Always put &lt;/html> on the last line. This ends the HTML document. 
### 2. Basic terminology
- Things inside &lt;>s are called **tags**.
- Tags nearly always come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag.
- Example of opening tag: &lt;html>
- Example of closing tag: &lt;/html>
