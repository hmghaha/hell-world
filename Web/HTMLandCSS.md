##Introduction to HTML
###HTML and CSS
- a. Always put <!DOCTYPE html> on the first line. This tells the browser what language it's reading (in this case, HTML).
- b. Always put <html> on the next line. This starts the HTML document.
- c. Always put </html> on the last line. This ends the HTML document.
